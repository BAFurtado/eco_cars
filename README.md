#### In construction

We simulate an Agent-based Model (ABM) based on van der Vooren and Brouillat (2015) that endogenously test green cars' 
markets to test alternatives of Brazilian Public Policies. The model contains consumers, firms and their cars (fossil 
or green) with endogenous budget and innovation mechanisms. Given alternative policies, the model outputs total 
emission, public expenditure and green market share. 

#### Python model by Bernardo A Furtado, based on:
Van der Vooren, A. and E. Brouillat (2015): “Evaluating co2 reduction policy mixes
in the automotive sector,” Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions, 14,
60–83.
